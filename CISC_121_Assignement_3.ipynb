        "This question asks for each day's temperature, how many days I may have to wait until a warmer temperature occurs. If there is no day in the future with a higher temperature than this day, the answer for this day is 0. Because the input array can be up to 100,000 elements, a solution that is better than O(n²) is needed. My plan is to use a monotonic stack that is decreasing, which will hold the indices of days for which I have not yet found a warmer day. So as I iterate through the array, for each temperature I will check to see if it is higher than the temperature of the array at the index of the top of the stack. If it is, pop it from the stack, calculate how many days it took to reach a higher temperature (current_index - previous_index) and place that result into the answer array. I will repeat this until the stack is empty or the current temperature is not warmer. Finally, push the current day's index to the stack. This means each day will only be pushed and popped at most once, which will have an O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity."

        "The problem is to find how many students in a cafeteria line cannot eat, based on their sandwich preferences and a stack of sandwiches. Each student in line takes the top sandwich if the student preference matches the sandwich. Otherwise, the student goes to the end of the line. The students continue in line until the top sandwich is not of preference to any student in line. The input consists of two arrays of equal length: students, representing each student's preference (0 for circular, 1 for square), and sandwiches, representing the stack of sandwiches with index 0 as the top. The output is the number of students remaining in the line when no student can take a sandwich. Instead of simulating rotations, I can count the number of students who prefer 0's and who prefer 1's. I can then iterate through the sandwich stack, decrementing the corresponding counts until no student can take the currently uncovered sandwich. This approach avoids unnecessary queue rotations and guarantees correct results even for edge cases, such as when all students prefer the same type of sandwich or when preferences alternate. The algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and a constant space complexity."

        "The problem is asking to calculate the number of different combinations to climb a staircase of n steps, given that in each move, I could take either 1 step or 2 steps in that specific action. The input is a single integer n representing the total steps to the top, and the output is an integer representing the total number of distinct sequences of 1-step and 2-step moves that reach the top. To solve this, I would take a single step from step i-1 to i, and take a double step from step i-2 to step i. So, to get to step i, the total ways will be the previous step (i-1) + the step before (i-2), which naturally leads to a recursive or dynamic programming approach similar to calculating Fibonacci numbers. Considering the constraints (1 <= n <= 45), an efficient solution can be implemented iteratively or recursively to avoid calculating overlapping steps and achieve approximately O(n) time and either O(1) or O(n) space complexity."

Because the array is sorted and can be a large size (up to 10⁵), an O(log n) solution is required, which means I need to use binary search instead of a linear search. The idea is to do two binary searches, one for the leftmost occurrence and one for the rightmost occurrence. During each search, adjust the search boundaries based on comparisons between the current middle element and the target. If both searches find the target, return the pair of indices that is returned after the two searches. If the target is not found in either the rightmost or leftmost search, I will return [-1, -1] to show that the target is not present. This method has logarithmic runtime and efficiently works with large data sets and edge cases."

The goal is to rearrange the array so that all 0s come first, followed by 1s, then 2s. This should be done in-place with O(1) extra space and ideally in one pass. To solve this, I will use 3 pointers - low (to mark where the next 0 goes), mid (to iterate through the array), and high(to mark where the next 2 goes). Inital pointing will have low/mid set to the beginning (high will be at the end of the array). As I loop through the array, if nums[mid] is 0, we swap it with nums[low] and move both pointers forward; if it’s 2, we swap it with nums[high] and move high backward; if it’s 1, we simply move mid forward. This is an in-place operation to sort for these discrete values."
